## 4. Install Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 5. Install Cairo Graphics Library

This is required for SVG to PNG conversion (via CairoSVG):

- **macOS:**  
  ```bash
  brew install cairo
  ```
- **Ubuntu/Debian:**  
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install libcairo2
  ```
- **Fedora:**  
  ```bash
  sudo dnf install cairo
  ```
- **Windows:**  
  - Follow the [CairoSVG Windows instructions](https://cairosvg.org/documentation/#installation).
  - You may need [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) or precompiled binaries.

---

## 6. Prepare Your Artwork

- Place your front cover, back cover, and monthly artwork images in the folder specified in `config/settings.json` (default: `./artwork`).
- Recommended format: PNG (or JPG).

---

## 7. Configure Your Calendar

- Edit `config/settings.json` to adjust:
  - Calendar year (`year`)
  - Holiday/event inclusion
  - Artwork file names and folder
  - Output directories for PDF, PNG, and JPG
  - Metadata and branding

---

## 8. Run the Calendar Compiler

```bash
python CalendarCompiler.py
```
*Or add CLI flags for advanced control:*
```bash
python CalendarCompiler.py --exportpdf --exportpng --cleanup
```

---

## 9. Output

- PDFs are written to `output_pdfs/` (by default)
- PNGs to `output_pngs/`
- JPGs to `output_jpgs/`
- SVGs to `calendars/`
- Adjust output folders in `settings.json` as needed

---

## 10. Troubleshooting

- **Missing cairo:**  
  If you see errors about missing `cairo`, ensure the library is installed (see step 5 above).
- **Artwork not found:**  
  Check that all art files listed in `settings.json` exist in your artwork folder.
- **Permission errors:**  
  Run your terminal/command prompt as administrator (Windows) or check directory permissions (macOS/Linux).
